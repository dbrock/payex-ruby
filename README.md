## Usage

This library only implements the "credit card redirect" method.

Here's how a basic credit card transaction works:

```ruby
require 'payex'

PayEx.account_number = 123456789
PayEx.encryption_key = 'e4939be3910ebu194'
PayEx.default_currency = 'SEK'
#PayEx.base_url = PayEx::TEST_URL # (use this for testing)

# (an arbitrary string you can use to identify this transaction)
my_order_id = 'c704acc45a4bec4c8cd50b73fb01a7c7'

payment_url = PayEx::CreditCardRedirect.initialize_transaction!
  order_id: my_order_id,
  product_number: '123456',
  product_description: 'Brief product description',
  price: 14900, # (in cents)
  customer_ip: '12.34.56.78',
  return_url: 'http://example.com/payex-return',
  cancel_url: 'http://example.com/payex-cancel'
```

After redirecting the customer to `payment_url`, they'll enter their
payment details and then PayEx will redirect them back to `return_url`
with a parameter called `orderRef` appended to the query string.

The `PayEx::CreditCardRedirect.complete_transaction!` method takes
this `orderRef` string as input and returns your order ID as output.

```ruby
order_id, error, raw_response =
  PayEx.complete_transaction! '9b4031c19960da92d'
case error
when nil
  # The transaction succeeded (use `order_id` to proceed).
when PayEx::Error::CardDeclined
  # The transaction was declined by the credit card company.
else
  # The transaction failed (look at `raw_response` for details).
end
```
